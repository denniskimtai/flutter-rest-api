# Flutter Rest Api 
This Flutter project demonstrates how to consume a REST API using the Dio package and display the retrieved data as a grid view. The app fetches product data from https://fakestoreapi.com/products and presents it in a visually appealing grid layout. It's a practical example of how to integrate network requests and dynamic UI rendering in a Flutter application.
